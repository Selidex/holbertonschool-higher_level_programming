2-matrix_divided
=================

This module divides all elements of a matrix by a given numbers

Proper Cases
===============
Testing to make sure that cases that should work do in fact work

::
  >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
  >>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
  >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
  [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Improper Cases
===============
Testing to make sure that improper cases work properly

Division by Zero
::
  >>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
  >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Div is not an integer
::
  >>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
  >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "bob")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: div must be a number

Martrix is not a list of lists
::
  >>> matrix_divided("ross", 3)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix is a matrix of non integers
::
  >>> matrix = [ ["a", "b" , "c"], ["d" ,"e","f"] ]
  >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix has different lengths
::
  >>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5] ]
  >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
